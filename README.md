Hello! This is a Minecraft: Java Edition Mod for 1.20.2 created with Fabric.
This mod adds a new type of boat: the large boat! This boat has four seats, as well as two-player control support and
the ability to hold a chest in any of the seats, or all of them. This mod also takes the opportunity to address the myriad issues
with Vanilla Minecraft boats, namely the 0.5 second lag, the slow packet rate and other annoying client-server desyncs
that can cause chaos in ice-boating races as well as the inability to move boats up a block easily, with a total
reimplementation of boat physics. It's only for the large boat for now, though a mixin to fix Vanilla boats could be done.

This mod will not be ported to (Neo)/Forge or backported, though I may forward port to 1.22 when it comes out or other
versions if I have time.

Heads up! - this is my first Minecraft mod as well as my first program in general that's going to be used by other people. 
If you want to check out the code, even though most of it is copied from trimmed-down versions of code in Minecraft itself 
for horse movement and other things, you should still be prepared to cringe. Remember, everyone starts somewhere. Please
have mercy. With that said, I welcome any attempt to improve this mess with pull requests, though it may take me a while
due to not having much time to mod.
