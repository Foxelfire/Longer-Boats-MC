For if I ever gain the confidence to show anyone else this:

Hello! This is a Minecraft: Java Edition Mod for 1.20.1 created with Fabric.
The goal of this project is simply for silly Foxelfire over here to learn how to code in Java in a real environment, learn Git, move on to more advanced concepts than just what their high school
CS class is teaching them, become more tech-savvy, etc. I'm not sure what this mod will add or do yet, but I will keep updating this as time goes on to get practice with writing READMEs. 
I'm considering this to be my first ever programming project. Everyone starts somewhere, so whoever you are, try to contain your anger while staring at my bad code that I'm sure I will end up writing.
